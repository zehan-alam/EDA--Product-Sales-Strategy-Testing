# EDA - Product Sales Strategy A/B Testing
It was a project given to me in *DataCamp Professional certification exam*. I completed it using python libraries and my knowledge of Data Analysis. </br>
This project involves analyzing sales data for a new line of office stationery using three different sales strategies: targeted email, phone calls, and a combination of both. The goal is to identify the most effective approach and provide recommendations to the sales team. The analysis includes data validation, exploratory analysis, and the definition of a metric for monitoring success. The report and presentation present findings on customer behavior, revenue distribution, and differences among sales methods. Recommendations is based on insights derived from the data to help the company optimize their sales approach for the new product line.
